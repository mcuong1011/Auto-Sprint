Remember to set keybind as following if u use the exe:
LAlt: Hold to Sprint (in-game)
RCtrl: EMERGENCY EXIT HOTKEY
LShift: TOGGLE SPRINT

Why do i use exe? Does not require to download ahk, just click and play
-> If u need to edit the script and turn it into a exe file, download Ahk2Exe in AHK app Dashboard 

Note: Do not use this in MP games that have Anti Cheat
After doing some research, I have found out that this script will not get u banned. However, the Anti Cheat will interfere with the script and therefore stops working even though AHK is still running in the background.
